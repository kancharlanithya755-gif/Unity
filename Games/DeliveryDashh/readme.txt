These two are the scripts that are written for the game delivery dash which i have learnt it in Udemy which were developed by using UNITY and C#.
This is the game of picking the package of items and delivering them to the customers:
This project was a deep dive into the fundamentals of game development, focusing on player mechanics and game loop logic.

Key features I implemented:
Player Controller: Smooth driving mechanics including steering, acceleration, and speed boosts.
Collision Logic: Using Unity’s 2D Physics engine to handle environmental obstacles.
Game Loop: A "pick-up and deliver" system where the player must collect ice cream and find the correct customer.
UI/UX: Integrated feedback systems like speed boosts and delivery indicators.
